# Data-Analytics--Day-2
## Total Sales Over Time
This line plot displays total sales aggregated by the "Year-Month" column for time series analysis. Each point on the plot represents the sum of sales for a particular month, showing trends such as peaks or dips in sales over time. The data points are connected to highlight the continuity of sales changes over months. This is helpful to understand seasonality, overall growth trends, or any patterns in sales performance.
## Sales by Category
This horizontal bar plot shows total sales for each product category, sorted in descending order. The  column is on the y-axis, while the x-axis represents total sales. The plot reveals which categories contribute most to sales revenue. For example, it can highlight whether "Technology," "Furniture," or "Office Supplies" dominates sales figures.
##  Profit by Sub-Category
This horizontal bar plot displays profit figures grouped by sub-categories, sorted in ascending order. Sub-categories that generate the least or even negative profit appear at the top, while the most profitable ones are at the bottom. By using contrasting colors, it effectively highlights sub-categories that may need optimization to improve profitability.
##  Sales vs Profit Bubble Chart by Segment
This scatter plot compares "Sales" (x-axis) and "Profit" (y-axis) for different customer segments. Bubble sizes are proportional to the sales value, providing a sense of scale for each segment. The data points are labeled with their respective segment names, making it easy to identify trends—e.g., which segment generates high sales but low profits, or vice versa. It visually balances the dynamics between sales volume and profitability across customer groups.
## Heatmap of Sales by Region and Category
This heatmap uses a pivot table to analyze sales across regions and product categories. The cells are color-coded based on the sales value, with annotations showing numerical sales figures. This plot provides insights into which region and category combinations perform best (darker shades indicate higher sales). It’s particularly useful for regional and product-level strategic planning.
